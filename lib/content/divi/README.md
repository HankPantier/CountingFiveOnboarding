# Divi / WordPress export bridge (temporary)

A **throwaway stop-gap** that exports a client's generated page content into a
WordPress import bundle for the shared **Divi boilerplate** site
(`c5d5.flywheelsites.com`). It exists only to get sites live faster while the
custom Next.js theme pipeline is still the long-term destination. When the theme
pipeline is the norm, **delete this feature** — see removal below.

## What it produces

A downloadable zip (`<site>-divi-customizer.json` + `<site>.wxr` + `<site>-divi-library.json` + `<site>-sitemap.pdf/.svg/.png` + `README.txt`):

- **Customizer JSON** (import first) — the client's styling as a Divi Theme
  Customizer import: six Global Colors (`gcid-c5-*`), heading/body fonts, H1–H6
  sizes, buttons, and a marked "Revaltus brand" block of Additional CSS (the
  template's fluid type scale, radii, shadows, serif headlines). Divi's import
  REPLACES all Customizer settings + Additional CSS, so the file is the
  boilerplate's full export (`__fixtures__/divi-customizer-base.json`) with only
  the styling keys changed and our CSS appended after the boilerplate's.

- **WXR** — every live `content/pages/*.md` rendered to Divi Builder shortcode
  (`content:encoded`, flagged `_et_pb_use_builder=on`), plus the primary nav menu
  (from the repo `nav.json`). Pages import as drafts.
- **Sitemap** — a PDF (summary, schematic, page directory with WordPress URL,
  parent, menu position and SEO fields) plus the schematic as SVG and PNG, for
  whoever runs the import. The PNG and PDF are fail-soft (omitted, with a README
  note, if they can't render).

### Styling = the client's design system

`style.ts` builds one model from `content/brand.json` + `content/design.json`
using the template's own contrast rules. Templates in `blocks.ts`/`library.ts`
never contain a hex: they carry tokens (`c5('primary')`, `c5('text')`,
`c5('action', 0.35)`, `pad(60)`, `radius('button')`) that `applyDiviStyle()`
resolves and links to Divi Global Colors via `global_colors_info` (the hex stays
in the attribute, so pages render even before the Customizer import). Heading
sizes are left to the brand CSS. Not portable: Design Studio custom CSS + style
axes (they target the template's markup). Refresh the base fixture by
re-exporting the boilerplate's Customizer settings.

### Menu = the editor's Pages sidebar

The Primary Menu and page nesting come from `content/nav.json` — the same tree
the content editor's Pages sidebar shows and edits — so the menu has the same
items, order and dropdown nesting. Absolute nav urls on the firm's host resolve
to their page (as in the sidebar). Pages under "Not in navigation" still import
but get no menu item; their WordPress parent follows the URL prefix. Every
page's `menu_order` follows sidebar order. No nav.json ⇒ an empty menu.
- **Divi Library JSON** — per-client branded Header (with Client Center portals)
  and Footer, for import into the Divi Library + assignment in Theme Builder.
- **README.txt** — operator import steps.

Images are **hot-linked** to stable Pexels CDN URLs (no Media Library upload).

## Source of truth: the live GitHub repo

The export reads the client's **live `draft` branch** (`content/pages/*.md`,
`content/nav.json`, `content/client-center.json`) — the same source as the
editor's "Download doc" — so it always matches what's live, including
post-generation edits. It does **not** read the original `generated_pages` rows.
Blog posts (`content/posts/*`) are excluded (Divi blog template is out of scope).

## How it maps

Page `.md` block annotations (`<!-- block: … -->`) → Divi shortcode shells lifted
from `raw-docs/Divi Builder Layouts.json`:

| Block | Divi output |
|---|---|
| `page-header` / hero frontmatter | `subPageHeader` / gradient `copyImageBlock` |
| `content-split`, `hero-split` | two-column `copyImageBlock` (+ hotlinked image) |
| `feature-grid`, `service-cards`, `industry-cards` | `cardGridBlock` (blurb cards) |
| `cta-banner` | `ctaBlock` |
| `faq-accordion` + `faq_block` column | `accordionBlock` |
| `pricing-plans` + `content/pricing-plans.json` | `pricingTablesBlock` (native `et_pb_pricing_tables` + shared-features/add-ons prose) |
| everything else | `basicContentBlock` (clean styled text — no content dropped) |

## Files

- `markdown.ts` — minimal markdown → Divi-safe HTML (no external dep)
- `sanitize.ts` — URL scheme allowlist + HTML-attribute escaping (XSS guard)
- `blocks.ts` — section parser + Divi shortcode template shells + renderers
- `images.ts` — Pexels query → hotlink URL resolver (dedup, fail-soft)
- `page.ts` — assemble one page's full Divi shortcode (hero + sections + FAQ)
- `from-frontmatter.ts` — live-repo `.md` (frontmatter + body) → `DiviPageInput`
- `wxr.ts` — WordPress WXR (pages + nav menu)
- `library.ts` — per-client Header/Footer Divi Library JSON
- `readme.ts` — the README.txt shipped in the zip
- `style.ts` — client style model, colour/padding tokens, `applyDiviStyle`, brand CSS
- `customizer.ts` + `__fixtures__/divi-customizer-base.json` — Customizer import file
- `sitemap.ts` — sitemap model (menu tree, not-in-nav group, WP permalinks)
- `sitemap-layout.ts` — schematic geometry shared by the SVG and PDF renderers
- `sitemap-svg.ts` / `sitemap-png.ts` / `sitemap-pdf.tsx` — the three renderers
  (PNG via `@resvg/resvg-js` + bundled Open Sans in `assets/`, OFL)
- `index.ts` — `buildDiviExport()` orchestrator (source-neutral) → zip Buffer

Consumed only by:
- `app/api/edit/[id]/export-divi/route.ts` (reads the live repo, sessionId-keyed)
- the "Export to Divi ↓" item in the editor ••• menu
  (`components/editor/EditorTopBar.tsx`)

## Removal (one move)

This feature is fully additive and self-contained — no migrations, no schema
changes, no edits to the existing content pipeline. To remove:

1. `rm -rf lib/content/divi` (and `npm rm @resvg/resvg-js`; drop its
   `serverExternalPackages` / `export-divi` tracing entries in `next.config.ts`)
2. `rm -rf app/api/edit/[id]/export-divi`
3. In `components/editor/EditorTopBar.tsx`, delete the "Export to Divi ↓" anchor
   in `OverflowMenu`.

Then `npx tsc --noEmit` — a clean compile confirms nothing else depended on it.
