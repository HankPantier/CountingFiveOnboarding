# WordPress blog-sync bridge (Revaltus)

A **one-way, opt-in** bridge that lets self-hosted WordPress (Divi) sites pull
published blog/resource posts from a client's git repo during the transition
period, while blogs are still authored and edited inside Revaltus.

It is deliberately **isolated and removable** — the sibling of the throwaway Divi
export bridge (`lib/content/divi/`). It is **not** wired into the content/publish
workflow, phase pipeline, publish gates, cron config, or editor UI. It adds:

- `lib/wordpress/` — feed builder + DB-backed site registry + image proxy helpers
- `app/api/wp-feed/[site]/` — the feed route + authenticated image-proxy route
- `app/api/admin/wordpress-sites/` — admin CRUD for the site registry
- `app/admin/wordpress-sites/` — the admin roster page (add/toggle/regenerate/delete)
- `wordpress_sites` table (migration 067) — one row per synced WP site
- `wordpress-plugin/revaltus-blog-sync/` — the PHP plugin operators install

## How it works

```
WP plugin (WP-cron)  ──GET /api/wp-feed/{site}  (Bearer secret)──▶  this app
   parse JSON posts                                                  reads content/posts/*.md
   upsert wp_posts by slug (publish)                                 from git `main` (GitHub App)
   sideload hero via /api/wp-feed/{site}/asset (Bearer) ◀────────────  streams private repo bytes
   posts missing from feed → set draft (never delete)
```

The app holds **all** GitHub credentials and serves clean JSON + proxied image
bytes. WordPress holds only a feed URL + a per-site bearer secret — never a
GitHub token. Repos are private, so hero images are emitted as authenticated
proxy URLs (`requires_auth: true`) that the plugin fetches with the bearer.

## Enabling a site (admin UI)

1. **Admin → WordPress Sites → Add site.** Enter a **site key** (URL slug, e.g.
   `acmetax`) and the **GitHub repo** (`name` or `owner/name`, same as
   `content_jobs.github_repo`). The app generates a bearer secret and shows it
   **once** with the feed URL — copy both.
2. Install the `revaltus-blog-sync` plugin on the WordPress site and paste the
   feed URL (`https://<app-host>/api/wp-feed/acmetax`) + the secret.
3. Click **Sync now** in WordPress (or wait for WP-cron).

Lost the secret? Use **Regenerate** on the row (rotates it, shown once) and
update the plugin. **Disable** flips `enabled` off (feed 404s); **Delete**
removes the row.

## Disabling

- **Per-site:** toggle the site off (or delete it) in the admin UI. The feed then
  returns 404 and the plugin **no-ops** (it never drafts posts on a non-200), so
  nothing is destroyed.

## Full removal (one move)

```
rm -rf lib/wordpress
rm -rf app/api/wp-feed
rm -rf app/api/admin/wordpress-sites
rm -rf app/admin/wordpress-sites
rm -rf wordpress-plugin/revaltus-blog-sync
rm components/admin/AddWordpressSiteDialog.tsx components/admin/WordpressSiteRow.tsx types/wordpress-sites.ts
# remove the "WordPress" link from components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx
# drop table: DROP TABLE wordpress_sites;  (+ remove the type block from types/database.ts)
npx tsc --noEmit   # clean compile confirms nothing else depended on it
```

## Scope / limitations (v1)

- **Posts only** (`content/posts/*.md`). Pages, nav, and client-center are out of
  scope (handled natively or by the Divi bridge).
- **One-way**: git is the source of truth; edits made inside WordPress are
  overwritten on the next sync.
- **Hero image only**: current generator output has no inline body images. If
  inline `![]()` images referencing repo assets are ever added, extend
  `markdownToHtml` (module-local copy) and populate `inline_images`.
- `github_repo` is duplicated from Supabase into the site row (intentional, for
  isolation) — keep it in sync if a repo is renamed.
